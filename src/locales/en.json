  "aboutContent": "I was born on August 29, 2001 (23 years old). I specialize in front-end development with ReactJS, modern UI frameworks, user-friendly experiences. My expertise extends into the Salesforce ecosystem, where I have worked extensively with Lightning Web Components (LWC), Apex, Visualforce, and REST API integrations to build scalable, business-driven solutions. Currently, I work at i2max, one of South Koreaâ€™s top Salesforce Platinum Partners, where I contribute to complex projects ranging from multimessenger integrations (Telegram, Line, WhatsApp, WeChat) to Experience Cloud portals for global brands like Hyundai, Kia, and Genesis. My work involves architecting dynamic user interfaces, integrating third-party tools, and optimizing system performance for enterprise clients.",
